### **Cashier: Cash Float Management (5)**
| Permission Key | Resource | Action | Description |

| `money-loan:cash:receive` | money-loan-cash | receive | Confirm end-of-day handover receipt from collectors |

| `money-loan:collector` | money-loan-collector | operate | Collector cash operations (confirm float, record transactions, handover) |

> **Note:** The 10K Cash Cycle system manages the daily cash flow from cashier to collector and back. Cashiers issue morning floats, collectors confirm receipt, use cash for disbursements/collections, and return remaining cash at end of day. All transactions are GPS-tracked and dual-confirmed for audit compliance.

**Cash Float Workflow:**
1. **Morning:** Cashier issues float → Collector confirms receipt
2. **Field:** Collector disburses loans (cash deducted) & collects payments (cash added)
3. **Evening:** Collector initiates handover → Cashier confirms receipt
4. **Audit:** Full transaction history with GPS coordinates and timestamps

**Safety Rules:**
- Disbursement amount ≤ on-hand cash AND ≤ daily cap
- Zero cash kept overnight (full handover required)
- Variance detection with mandatory explanation
- Real-time balance tracking per collector

> **Removed Legacy Keys:** The broad tenant permissions `loans:*` and `payments:*` (including `money-loan:read/create/update/approve/payments`) were retired in November 2025. They are no longer present in the database and should not be assigned going forward.

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### **Deprecated Permissions**
The following broad permissions are deprecated in favor of granular permissions:

- `money-loan:read` → Use specific `money-loan:loans:read`, `money-loan:customers:read`, etc.
- `money-loan:create` → Use `money-loan:loans:create`
- `money-loan:update` → Use `money-loan:loans:update`
- `money-loan:approve` → Use `money-loan:loans:approve`
- `money-loan:payments` → Use `money-loan:payments:create`

**Action Required:** Update role assignments to use new granular permissions for better security control.

## 📝 Notes

1. **Space:** Permissions can be `system` or `tenant` scoped
2. **Format:** All permission keys follow `{resource}:{action}` pattern
3. **Granularity:** Money Loan permissions are highly granular for precise access control
4. **Extensibility:** New products (BNPL, Pawnshop) will follow the same pattern
5. **Legacy Support:** Old permission keys maintained for backward compatibility but deprecated
